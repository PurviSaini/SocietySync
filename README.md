# Society Sync
#### _Sync your college socities with ease_

## Problem Statement
Challenges with Current Society Management System:

- Tasks managed through WhatsApp
- Important messages lost in the clutter
- Confusion and chaos in communication



## Project Overview
A streamlined task management platform to replace the chaotic WhatsApp-based system for a 
college society, enhancing organization and clarity in task assignment and tracking. The platform 
features three user roles—Core Members, Associates, and Coordinators—each with distinct 
interfaces and permissions. Core Members can upload and assign tasks to specific teams or all 
teams and monitor task progress and assignments across all teams. Associates manage tasks for 
their teams, assigning tasks to Coordinators or accepting tasks themselves, while Coordinators 
accept and complete tasks assigned by Associates. This solution significantly reduced confusion, 
improved accountability, and increased efficiency across all levels of society.
